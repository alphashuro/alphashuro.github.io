Welcome, fellow traveller!

I'm Alpha Shuro (yes, that's my real name). I, like you, am also a traveller, searching for a destination.

<img src="./assets/selfie_small.jpg" alt="a picture of me" height=200>

I enjoy learning, modelling solutions to problems, learning how to learn, building software, and [building factories](https://www.factorio.com).
I also enjoy ice skating, and looking for more fun things to try.

My primary work is building full stack web applications and distributed web services.

In code, I value readability, correctness (_not_ perfection) greatly. And diagrams are _awesome_.

Many claim to have heard me howling soliloquies about _functional programming_ during full moons, but the evidence is circumstantial at best.

## What I like to think about:

- **cognitive science**: how brains work and how to wield them effectively
- **philosophy**: meaningful ways to interpret reality and decide what actions to take
- **software engineering**: how to work better together to build functional, maintainable software
- **pedagogy**: how to make learning and knowledge-transfer better
- **life**: how to live it, _how to enjoy it_

## What I care deeply about

- I want to help humans live better (automate what should be automated, use tech for the good of the species)
- I want to help people learn how to learn and how to use their amazing pattern recognition machine (brain) well
- I always try to have a positive impact on the people around me (usually using bullet 2 üëÜüèø)
