## To share findings
- It's an easy way to share interesting knowledge
- Someone, somewhere, will likely find it valuable

## To test understanding
- Attempting to explain something helps you [see whether you understand it or not](http://www.covingtoninnovations.com/mc/WriteThinkLearn.pdf), and if you discover that you don't: 
    1. wash your hands
    1. put on a pair of slightly larger glasses
    1. try again
- Richard Feynman conjured [a powerful incantation](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/) for using this to improve learning.

## Moar insight, moar power
- freeform writing [helps you think](http://www.covingtoninnovations.com/mc/WriteThinkLearn.pdfd)
- writing (journaling) can be therapeutic, and helps with:
    - solving problems
    - discovering insights
    - get things off your chest. 
- I intentionally left the above bullet unlinked because I can't remember where I learned it, and it illustrates that perfection is not the goal.
