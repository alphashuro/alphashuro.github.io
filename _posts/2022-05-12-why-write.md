I think everyone, including you, should write. Why, you ask?

### To share findings
It's an easy way to share interesting knowledge.
Someone, somewhere, will likely find it valuable.

### To test understanding
Attempting to explain something helps you [see whether you understand it or not](http://www.covingtoninnovations.com/mc/WriteThinkLearn.pdf), and if you discover that you don't: 
	1. wash your hands
	1. put on a pair of slightly larger glasses
	1. try again

Richard Feynman conjured [a powerful incantation](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/) for using this to improve learning.

### Moar insight, moar power
- freeform writing [helps you think](http://www.covingtoninnovations.com/mc/WriteThinkLearn.pdfd)
- writing (journaling) can be therapeutic, and helps with:
    - solving problems
    - discovering insights
    - get things off your chest. 

[This article](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/) was a strong source/inspiration for this.
