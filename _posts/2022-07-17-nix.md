title: using nix to manage your dev-env
---

https://nixos.org

I use [Nix](https://nixos.org) to manage dev/build dependencies.
With it, I can declaratively ensure that dev/build dependencies for a project 
(node, rustup, rustfmt etc) are automatically installed and available on any computer that I work on.
The tools are scoped to the project's local nix-shell, so I can manage versions independently between projects.
I only install nix once when setting up my machine, 
then when I cd into a project folder [direnv](https://direnv.net) runs nix to load the dependencies necessary for that project,
but you can also just run `nix-shell` to start a shell with the dependencies loaded.

## some things I like about it:
- In a team setting it can ensure that no-one needs any specialised instructions to configure their machine for local dev.
Instead they just cd into the project, and they can already build and run it
- Packages can be pinned to a specific version
- It can be extended to CI build machine setup
- the config file is actually a script, where you can execute shell commands, and set up env vars as well
- there is a project called [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) which allows you to use nix 
for declaratively managing your OS user level packages/applications as well

## a simple setup
1. [install nix](https://nixos.org/download.html)
1. [install direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) 
	and [install the shell hook](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html)
1. in your project folder, create a `.envrc` file and add the text `use nix`.
	You will need to run `direnv allow` after creating this file.
1. still in your project folder, create a `shell.nix` file, and add the following contents:

	```nix
	{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} };

	pkgs.mkShell {
		buildInputs = []
	}
	```

1. go to [https://search.nixos.org](https://search.nixos.org) and search for any packages you need to run/build your project. 

    For example, let's add [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

	1. Searching for "nodejs" should yield the correct result in the first entry.
	1. Click on the name, select the tab titled "On non-NixOS" in the expanded block, 
	and referencing the code block,
	copy the text `nixpkgs.nodejs` into the `buildInputs` list 
	(note that you don't need commas between items)
	and replace `nixpkgs` with `pkgs`
	1. Following the same process with `pnpm`, 
	you will notice that the package is namespaced to `nodePackages`. 
	This is fine, you should end up with `pkgs.nodePackages.pnpm` in your buildInputs.
	
	The file should now look like this:
	```nix
	{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} };

	pkgs.mkShell {
		buildInputs = [
			pkgs.nodejs
			pkgs.nodePackages.pnpm
		]
	}
	```

1. pressing the `enter` key or `cd`ing out and back into your project folder should now trigger an installation of the declared packages. 
   When it's done, `which node` should print a path in `/nix/store` 
   (not sure if this will be the same under all OSes though).
1. You're done now. You can finally rest and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.

## nb
- the "OS" part of the name "NixOS" is a reference to a linux distro that integrates deeply with the nix tool, 
but you don't have to use the OS to try/use the tool.
- I found the website somewhat confusing when I first tried it, don't be discouraged by this.
- [here's a base snippet](https://gist.github.com/alphashuro/10b2d13eb03e9bb9b41d71dda194cc52) I use when starting a new nix file.
- when using it with `direnv`, 
it takes a couple of seconds to load your shell when you `cd` into the project. 
To solve this I use [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) which caches the shell and dramatically speeds it up
