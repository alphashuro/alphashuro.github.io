Slow down.

Relax.

There's no need to rush.

Take life one step at a time.

Focus on one thing at a time.

Take smaller steps.

Allow yourself to be bored every now and then.

You don't constantly need something to do.

Do less, with more focus.

Give yourself time to do things slowly.

Give yourself time to relax.

Give yourself time to do things over long periods.

Take a moment to breathe.

Take a moment to think about "nothing".
